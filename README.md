The Falling Coconut

Let's play! https://lysxnn.github.io/falling-coconut/

The Falling Coconut is a game where you have to catch coconuts with the tikimask. Move your tikimask with the arrows in everey direction and increase your score. Get as many as you can but try not to miss one. The game will count the missed 

Backlog aka wishlist:
- evaluate top scores
- let the player choose a tikimask
- play a "thud" (dropping) sound for every coconut you miss
- specify scores with using different pieces of coconuts (smaller and bigger ones)
- animate the game-over-screen
