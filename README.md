# The Falling Coconut

Let's play! https://lysxnn.github.io/falling-coconut/

The Falling Coconut is a game where you have to catch coconuts with the tikimask. Move your tikimask with the arrows in everey direction and increase your score. Get as many as you can but try not to miss one because more then 10 mmissed coconuts will end the game!

## MVP
- catch coconuts to increase your score
- move the Tikimask in all directions (left, right, up, down)
- score from all sides (for- and backwards)
- game is over when more then 10 coconuts are dropped

## Backlog
- evaluate top scores
- let the player choose a tikimask
- play a "thud" (dropping) sound for every coconut you miss
- specify scores with using different pieces of coconuts (smaller and bigger ones)
- animate the game-over-screen
